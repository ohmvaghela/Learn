## Collections

## JAR files
- `.jar` is a package format
- It is a collection of many Java class files and associated metadata and resources (text, images etc.)
- This is like a package in other languages which we import
- We need a tool to manage these, we cant manually download and place these JAR files in correct folder every time
- Hence tools like Maven are used for the same
