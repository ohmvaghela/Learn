# AGILE

## Challenges with conventional ways
- Traditionally waterfall method was used
	- Waterfall is linear approach to software development
	- Here each phase is starts after last one is finished
	- No overlapping in phases
	- A comprehensive documentation is prepared for each phase
	- Predictable timetable : timeline for each phase have set durations
- Problems with waterfall method
	- Inflexibility to changing requirements
	- High risk of project failure due to delayed feedback
	- Difficult to accomodate to customer's need
	- Lengthy development cycles
	- High documentation overhead

## AGILE
- It is a `project management` and `software developmet` approach that aims to more effectiveness
	- It focuses on delivering small pieces, rather than one large big launch
	- This allows team to adapt quickly to customer's need	
- Features of agile
	1. Iterative development
	2. Incremental delivery
	3. Flexibility
	4. Collaboration : between teams and cross functional communication
	5. Customer Involvement
	6. Continous Improvement
- AGILE Family
	1. CRYSTAL 
		- Deliver software in short working cycles
		- Crystal is tailored to specific project and organizational requirements
	2. SCRUM
		- Deliver software in short cycles called `sprints`
		- Terminologies
			- Sprints : Timed box iterations 2-4 weeks
			- Daily SCRUM : Team meeting to discuss progress and plans
			- SCRUM Master : Facilitates SCRUM and remove impurities
	3. DSDM (Dynamic systems Development method)
		- same as other ass-holes
		- Consist of 3 phases
			1. Feasibility Study : Access project viability
			2. Business Study : Define business requirements
			3. Technical Development: Develop the software
- Non AGILE
	- SPIRAL
		- Spiral is a risk-driven software development methodology
		- same iterative and incremental
		- focuses on addressing risks and uncertainties in the development process.
		- 4 Phases
			- Planning: Identify and prioritize risks
			- Risk Analysis: Analyze and mitigate risks
			- Engineering: Develop the software
			- Evaluation: Review and refine the software
