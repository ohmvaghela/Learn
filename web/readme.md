# API
## Basic HTTP Methods
- **GET:**
    - Generally used to fetch data.
    - Idempotent.
- **POST:**
    - Generally used to create/add new data.
    - **Non-idempotent.**
- **PUT:**
    - Generally used to update data (replace the entire resource).
    - Full entity is typically sent to be updated.
    - **Idempotent.**
- **PATCH:**
    - Generally used to update data (partial modification of a resource).
    - Only the part of the entity to be updated is typically sent.
    - **Idempotency depends on the implementation.**
- **DELETE:**
    - Generally used to delete an entity.
    - **Idempotent.**

## Idempotency
- Idempotency means that multiple identical requests have the same effect as a single request.
- Example:
    - A PUT request to update the name from `ohm` to `ohm1` will return the same resource state every time, regardless of how many times it's sent.
    - Hence, it's idempotent.
- **Key Points:**
    - **POST is inherently non-idempotent.**
    - **PATCH's idempotency is determined by the server-side implementation.**
    - **PUT, GET, HEAD, DELETE, OPTIONS, and TRACE are designed to be idempotent.**
    - Ultimately, it's the developer's responsibility to ensure that idempotent methods are implemented correctly.
    - Example of non-idempotent PATCH:
        - A PATCH request used to increment a counter will produce a different result with each request.
    - Example of idempotent PATCH:
        - A PATCH request that updates the name from `ohm` to `ohm1` will result in the same outcome regardless of the number of requests.

## Different Request Body
- `application/json`

  ```json
  {
    "username": "john_doe",
    "password": "secure123"
  }
  ```

- application/x-www-form-encoded
  - Generally used to submit forms
  - It is how url handles params
  - key=value&key=value&...
  - As used to submit form vulnerable to CSRF
    - Hence CSRF should be used

  ```url
  username=john_doe&password=secure123
  ```

- multipart/form-data
  - Different types of data can be sent in one request like text, image, json ....

    <details>
      <summary>request</summary>

      ```
      ### Fetch Bill by Email with Multipart Form
      POST http://localhost:8000/fetchOrderByEmail
      Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW

      ------WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW
      Content-Disposition: form-data; name="image"; filename="your_image.jpg"
      Content-Type: image/jpeg

      < ./your_image.jpg  # Replace with the actual path to your image file

      ------WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW
      Content-Disposition: form-data; name="jsonData"
      Content-Type: application/json

      {
          "shopEmail": "vaghleaohm@gmail.com"
      }

      ------WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW
      Content-Disposition: form-data; name="plainText"

      This is some plain text.

      ------WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW--
      auth-token: token
      ```
      
    </details>

- application/octet-stream
  - Used for data streaming, blob

## Ways to send Token in header
- There 3 common ways to send in header
  - Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
  - Authorization: Token <JWT>
  - X-Auth-Token: <JWT>
- It is generally advised to send them via cookie so client side dont need to explicitly handle it

## Common Status code

| Color | Code | Description |
|---|---|---|
| ðŸŸ¢ | 200 OK | Standard response for successful HTTP requests. |
| ðŸŸ¢ | 201 Created | Request succeeded, and a new resource was created. |
| ðŸŸ¢ | 204 No Content | Request succeeded, but there's no content to return. |
| ðŸ”´ | 400 Bad Request | Server couldn't understand the request due to invalid syntax. |
| ðŸ”´ | 401 Unauthorized | Client lacks valid authentication credentials. |
| ðŸ”´ | 403 Forbidden | Client is authenticated but lacks permission to access the resource. |
| ðŸ”´ | 404 Not Found | Server couldn't find the requested resource. |
| ðŸ”´ | 409 Conflict | Request couldn't be completed due to a conflict with the resource's current state. |
| ðŸŸ  | 500 Internal Server Error | Server encountered an unexpected condition preventing it from fulfilling the request. |

## API versioning 
- It can be done using 
  - URL path param like `domain.com/v1/api`
  - URL query param like `domain.com/api?version=v1`
  - Header
  - Body

## Rate limiting 
- ### Client Based Rate limiting 
  - Limits the number of requests a specific client (identified by IP address, API key, user ID, etc.) can make within a given time window.
  - Stratergies
    - Token Bucketing
      - Imagine a bucket with a fixed capacity. Each request consumes a "token."
      - Tokens are replenished at a fixed rate.
      - If the bucket is empty, requests are rejected.
      - This allows for burst requests as long as the bucket has tokens.
    - Leaky Bucket
      - Similar to the token bucket, but requests "leak" out of the bucket at a fixed rate.
      - If the bucket is full, new requests are rejected.
      - This provides a smoother, more consistent rate limit
    - Fixed Window:
      - Limits the number of requests within a fixed time window (e.g., 100 requests per minute).
      - Once the window expires, the counter resets.
      - Simple to implement, but can lead to bursts at the window boundary.
    - Sliding Window:
      - A more refined version of the fixed window.
      - Instead of a fixed window, it uses a sliding window (e.g., the last minute).
      - This prevents bursts at window boundaries and provides a smoother rate limit
- ### Server Based Rate limiting
  - Concurrency limits
    - Limits the number of concurrent requests the server can handle.
    - New requests are queued or rejected if the limit is reached.
    - Protects against server overload.
  - Request Query
    - All the requests are in query
    - And are processed as the resource becomes available
- ### Geographic Rate Limiting:
  - Limits requests based on the geographic location of the client.
- ### Application-Specific Rate limiting 
  - Tailored rate limits based on the specific API endpoint or functionality

## Pagination
- Method used to send large data as small chunks
- Techniques
  - ### Page based pagination
    - Data is broken into pages of equal size
      - `GEt /api?page=2&size3`
    
    ```json
    page1:{
      "data1"
      "data2"
      "data3"
    },
    page2 : {
      "data4"
      "data5"
      "data6"
    }
    ```

  - ### Offset based pagination
    - Offset is the offset from the starting key and limit is number of data points
      - `/api/products?offset=20&limit=10`
    - So skip first 20 datapoints and give next 10 data points
  - ### Cursor based pagination
    - Uses primary key of last fetched data as custor and limit as number of data points
      - `/api/products?cursor=product_id_123&limit=10` 
    - returns 10 products after the item with ID 123
  - ### Key Based Pagination
    - This is a variant of cursor based pagination
    - Uses a unique, ordered key (like a timestamp or ID) to determine the next page
    - `/api/products?last_id=123&limit=10` 
      - returns 10 products with IDs greater than 123

# CSRF (Cross-Site Resource Forgery)
- Generally users have session stored on a website say website A, 
- Now say user visit to another website B, and it is malicious website
- So website B will run as script to call request to Website A on behalf of user
- To prevent this CSRF token embaded in HTML, and HTTP-only is set to true so no one can access JS code from outside
- And this token is sent to vailidate requst 

# gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)
- Like we have system calls for appications to communicate with OS locally
- We have RPC, Remove Procedure to call from one system to other 
- gRPC is popular implementation of RPC
- It uses protocal buffer to encode message (.proto) files

# JWT 
## Authorisation v/s Authentication
- `Authentication` :  is verifying the true identity of a user or entity
  - Done for when the user comes to website for first time
  - Like login/signup
- `Authorization` :  Determine access level of user, i.e. the resources that the user can access

  > ### JWT is used for authorization, `not for authentication`

- Authorization using SessionID
  - After authentication server generates SesisonID
  - Server stores SessionID, and also sends it back to client
  - Now for every request client sends sessionID to verify itself 
  - <img src="./images/image.png">
  - Here server needs to store `session ID`
- But this JWT uses a token instead of session ID
  - Here after authentication server creates a JWT with a secret key that only server has
  - Now each time client makes a request the server verifies the token with its secret key 
  - So here no extra memory is stored and no searching of id
  - <img src="./images/image-1.png">

## Ways of using JWT
- There are two types of tokens usually stored on client side
  - Access Token
  - Refresh Token
- `Access token` 
  - have relatively short lifespan (10-15min)
  - Are stored in session storad
- `Refresh Token`
  - Have relatively long lifespan (from days to months)
  - Are stored in HTTP-only cookies for enhanced security


# Browser Storage
## Browser has three types of storages   
  - Local Storage
  - Session Storage
  - Cookie Storage

|| Local Storage | Session Storage | Cookie Storage |
|-|-|-|-|
| Storage Cap | 5-10MB | 5MB | 5KB |
| Expiration | Never/set Manually | Till the tab is open | Never / set manually |
| Access | All tabs of browser | Same tab only | All tabs + server |
| Sent with request | Nop | Nop | Always sent with request |

## Local Storage & Session Storage 
- Data is stored as key value pairs

## CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
- On both server and client side we need to mention 
  - What kind of resources are acceptable
  - From what urls resources are accepted
- While defining CORS option we specifiy 
  - Credentials : True/False : Are we expecting any of following credentials?
    - Cookies 
    - Authorization Header 
    - Server/Client-side SSL certificates 
  - AllowedHeader : List of Allowed headers
    - Auth-Token
    - Content-Type
  - Origin : List of urls from where server will accept requests
  - allowedMethods : Allowed methods : (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS)
  - Prefilght : For complex request brower requests this(Preflight) from server

## Cookie Attribures
### Core Attributes
  - Name
  - Value
  - Domain : URL from where cookie is recieved
  - Path : The path where cookie is valid 
    - If path is `url/home`
    - And if you try to access cookie from `url/dashboard` it will be termed as invalid
    - It can also be accessed from `url/home/*`
  - Expires/ Max Age
  - Size : Brower defines it after determining it's size

### Security and Privacy Attribute
  - HttpOnly : If true client-side JS wont be able to access it
  - SameSite : Determines when the cookie is to be sent 
    > - SameSite : Two urls are samesite when scheme(HTTP/HTTPS) and domain matches
    > - CrossSite : When either of one schema or domain does not match
    - Strict : Cookie sent when user is on the SameSite
    - Lax : 
      - Cookie is sent on SameSite
      - When a new site opens from by clicking on url of sameSite cookie is sent
    - None : Allows all cross site 
  - Secure : When true, cookie is sent only to HTTPS secured server
  - Partitioned?
  - Priority?
