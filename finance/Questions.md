# Questions
- # Core business
    - Is there a clearly defined Mission Statement or Strategic business direction?
    - How does the company actually make money?
    - Does it sell physical products (e.g. manufacturing) or services (e.g. hospital, school)?
    - Can you clearly define the product or service category and customer profile, i.e. geography, demographic?
    - What resources (i.e. staff, R&D, investments) must it deploy to satisfy its customers?
    > ### Red flags
    > - If, after reviewing the company profile and introductory pages of the annual report, you remain unclear on how the company makes money, you are best advised to look at another.
    > - Suggestion: Pick companies in industries you are familiar.
    > - Note: If the company is a conglomerate (i.e., has multiple unrelated lines of business) concentrate on the key divisions."

- # Is Management Focused
    1. What are the managementâ€™s stated plans to take the business forward?
        1. Expanding capacity?
        2. Rationalizing underperforming areas?
        3. Introducing new products / services to existing customers?
        4. Investing to raise margins (e.g. new product features, service add-ons) via R&D, marketing, etc?
    2. Any acquisitions to facilitate 1.1, 1.2 or 1.4?

    > ### Red flags
    > - Question investments or acquisitions in areas which do not facilitate `1.1` - `1.4` e.g. a manufacturing firm buying land for property development.
    > - Question if stated plans are unclear, or do not take the company forward, or do not make sense to you in light of what you know.

- # ARE RISKS BEING ADDRESSED
    - What risks have management highlighted?
    - How are these risks being addressed?
    - Has management added to the risks, e.g. more than doubling its size via acquisitions? Can this be effectively managed?
    > ### Red flags
    > - Be vigilant on risks that have been highlighted.
    > - Beware of management who fail to mitigate risks. If information on risk mitigation is insufficient, query."


- # IS MANAGEMENT CONSISTENT
    - Are plans discussed in the past still on-track?
    - Are risks foreseen in the past under control?
    - Is there any change to overall tone? More optimistic or pessimistic?
    > ### Red flags
    > - If past plans are no longer discussed, query. 
    > - If risks highlighted in the past are no longer addressed, query. 
    > - If change in tone does not make sense, query.


- # CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DISCLOSURES
    - Companies must highlight where they do not comply with the IndAS, MCA and regulatory guidelines. Review all highlighted areas.
    - Review Independent directors who should be at least one third of board composition. Are they independent?

- # FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
    - "Did Net profit rise or fall due to change in: 
        1. Sales? 
        2. Gross margin? 
        3. Operating margin? 
        4. Interest expense, taxes? 
        5. Non-recurring items?"
    > ### Red flags
    > - We always like to see improvements in sales and margins at all levels. However, the key is to assess sustainability. 
    > - Red flags would be: 
    >    - steadily declining margins; 
    >    - dependency on non-recurring gains."

    # 
    - Is cash-cycle rising or falling? Why?

    > ### Red flags
    > - If cash-cycle rises, then inventory and receivables might be piling up too fast. A small red flag.


    - Is operating cash flow sound? 
        1. Is inventory rising much faster than COGS? 
        2. Are receivables rising faster than sales?"	
    > ### Red flags
    > - Fast growing companies typically register negative Operating Cash Flow (OCFs). 
    >     - Otherwise, negative OCFs are a red flag. Where has the cash been used? Query.

    #

    - Is Gearing too high? e.g. Net Gearing > 50%
        - Is Debt repayable within 1 year very close to Net OCF for the firm?
    > ### Red flags
    > - Financial leverage levels are industry specific, and they are best benchmarked against industry peers. Regardless, high short term debt levels vs. cash flow are generally considered risky.

    #

    - Is ROE improving or declining?	
    > ### Red flags
    > - Rising earnings with steadily declining ROEs are a red flag.

    #
    - Review changes to accounting policy, e.g. depreciation and R&D capitalization.	
    > ### Red flags
    > - Changes to accounting policy can distort earnings.
    > - Beware of changes that bring forward revenue or delay expense recognition. 
    > - Query if reasons are not clear.

- # OTHER AREAS
    - Assess the segmental breakdown of sales, profitability, assets & capital expenditurea. 
        1. Is YoY change in sales and earnings by geography in synchrony with economic conditions for those regions? 
        2. Do capital expenditure figures make sense? 
        3. For banks, note the loans growth by segment. Is the bank taking sensible risk vs. current economic condition? 
        4. For real estate, note capital expenditure by geography. Are they expanding exposure sensibly?"
    > ### Red flags
    > - Weakness in some segments might be offset by gains in others. This breakdown can sometimes help identify stability and non-recurring boosts.

    #
    - Is there a stated dividend policy with a specific Dividend Payout? Is Actual Dividend Payout steady, rising or falling? 
    - Note that Dividend Payouts can range from 0% (typical of high growth firms) to 100% (very stable cash cows). Companies expecting modest 5-15% annual growth can theoretically afford 20% to 40% dividend payouts."
    > ### Red flags
    > - Question when companies cut dividend payouts. 
    > - Be wary of companies which accumulate cash on their balance sheet with no clear investment plans.


    #
    - Is the cash really there? i.e. Reconcile cash level to interest income
    - Are cash holdings excessive vs. stated investment plans?
    > ### Red flags
    > - If interest yield is too low vs. available interest rates for an extended period, be wary

    #
    - Is the company doing what they say? Which segments are seeing capital employed/ total assets rising?
    - Which asset items on the balance sheet are rising or falling? 
    > ### Red flags
    > - If the items on the balance sheet (asset item) or in the segmental breakdown do not reconcile with the answer to Q3, be wary.

    #
    - Did independent auditors give a clean bill of health?
    > ### Red flags
    > - Beware of qualifications and emphasis of matter by auditors.
