## Types of financial statement of company
- Balance Sheet 
- Income statement
    - `SG&A (Selling General and Administrative)` also known as `Operating cost` 
    - It may cover R&D cost
    - `Sale` & `Revenue` are same thing
    - Non-recurring Charges or gains
        - One time charges or gains like cost of closing factory 
        - Mostly this will be empty
        - If this are significant then you may need to worry that are these charges really part of this or its company's loss that is trying to hide
    - Interest 
        - This is the money paid or recieved from bonds
- Cash flow statement
    - Cashflow from Investing 
        - Cash used for generating assets
        - Also cash generated from investments
    - Cashflow from Financing
        - Cash flow between company and owner
        - Divident payment, share buyback
    - Cashflow from operations  
        - Cash generated from business operations
        - Buying and selling of inventory 
        - Paying wages
        - Changes in Working Captial
            - Changes in Current assets and current liabilities are listed over here 
    
## Terminologies
- As on : Spending or value from the start of compnay till today
- For the year : Spending or value of current financial year
- Subsidiery company : If parent company holds `more then 50%` share in child compnay the it is subsidary of the parent
- Associate company : if a company holds 20-50% share of a company then it is associate 
- Joint venture : If two compnaies come together for a specific project/purpose with defined boundary and resources
- Balance sheet are always `as on`
- Profit and loss are always `for the year`

# Fundamental analysis

## Layers of fundamental analysis
- Economy analysis 
    - Overall economy analysis
    - Can be done by reading financial report
- Industry Analysis
    - State of sector
    - Can be found from financial report
- Compnay analysis
    - Can be done from financial report

> ### Intrinsic Value 
> - It assumes company's price is not determined by stock price 
> - It assumes company's price is determined by company's finanicals
> - It don't takes sector, economy, and other lawsuits into account

> ### Different types of analysis
> - Quantative : Analysis based facts and figures
> - Qualitative : Based on business model, management, corporate governance, market etc.

# Important figures in Stock market

- ## Market Capitalisation
    - Total value of outstanding shares
    - MarketCap = `Number of outstanding shares` x `Share price`
- ## Enterprice Value
    - Total value of company inculding liabilities and cash equivalents
    - Enterprice Value = MarketCap + Debt - Cash reserves
- ## Free Cash Flow
    - Cash produced by company's operations - cost of expenditure
    - It shows company's ability to invest in future in creating new assets and source of income
- ## Intrest Coverage Ratio / Times Interest Earned (TIE)
    - How many times can a company pay its interest on its outstanding loan
    - TIE = EBIT / Interest Expense
    - Better to look at quaterly statements rather then yearly 
    - 1.5 or more is considered good, but it depends on industry
- ## COGS 
    - Cost of goods sold
- ## Gross Profit v/s Operating Profit v/s Net Profit v/s Free Cash Flow
    - Gross profit = Sales - COGS(Cost of goods sold)
    - Operating Profits = Gross Profit - Operating Cost - Depreciation and Amortisation
    - Net Profit = Operating Profit - Non Operating Expenses


# Ratios

## Liquidity ratio

- ### Working Captial Ratio
    - Access company's liquidity position
    - Working captial =  current assets - current liability
    - Working capital ratio = Current Asset / Current Liabilities
    - A very high value like 2-3 means company cant use its surplus cash to grow, or its growth is at its peak
- ### Acid test / Quick ratio
    - Acud test = Highly liquid assets / currnet liabilities
    - Ability of company to cover its short term obligaions
    - ratio greater then 1 is good
    - But there may be cases where it is not greater than 1 like in retail as inventory is not accounted 
        - So over here quick ratio can be less then 1 
    - If account Recivable (AR) is not recivable before next debt payment then it may be a problem

## Profitability Ratio

- ### Earning Per Share (EPS)
    - Used for finding profitability of a company
    - Also shows confidance of investor in the company
    - EPS = Net Income / Outstanding shares
    - It does not include debt 
    - ### Basic v/s Diluted EPS
        - Basic EPS does't take convertable security into account
        - Diluted EPS takes convertable security like `ESOPS`, `Convertable Prefered Shares(CPS)`, `Debts`, `Equity` into account 
    - ### EPS Excluding Extraordinary Items
        - If there is something extraordinary happened in this year 
        - like say fire in factory, law suit, price earned or loss due to factory relocation
- ### Price to Earning Ratio (P/E)
    - How much investor has to pay in order to earn `one rupee`
    - P/E = Current Stock price / EPS
    - High P/E
        - Company is overvalued
        - Investor are optimistic about their growth
    - Newly listed company may have zero or negative P/E
- ### Return On Equity (ROE)
    - ROE = Net Income (PAT) / Total shareholder's equity
        - Here PAT is income before paying divident to common share holders and paying divident to prefered shareholder
    - It does not change rapidly like other ratios
    - It can be divided into 3 parts
        - `ROS (Return on Sales)` or `Net Margin` : Net Income / Sales
        - `Asset Turn Over` : Sales / Asset
        - Leverage : Asset / Equity
    - Combining `ROS` and `Asset turn over` we get `Return on Assets (ROA)`
    - If company has very high ROE then there few checks for financial health
        - Is company financing its operations from debt
            - or is company truely performing well
            - This can be seen if income to operating cost is high or ROS is high
        - Other reason can be negative income 
        - Other reason is company buying back shares
            - Can be a good sign as management is strong and sees company's potential growth
- ### Gross Margin or Gross Profit Margin (GPM)
    - GPM = Gross Profit / Revenue
- ### PreTax Margin
    - PreTax Margin = EBIT / Revenue
- ### Net Profit Margin (NPM)
    - NPM = Net Profit / Revenue
> Mostly we see GPM and NPM as we can get to know the margin on product from GPM and efficiency of making and selling from NPM
- ### Return on Invested Captial (ROIC)
    - A comprehensive measure of how efficiently a company uses its invested capital (debt and equity) to generate profits.
    - ROIC = Net Income (PAT) / Invested Capital
        - Invested capital : All expences used for operations including debt and equity for operations 
    - Focuses on the efficiency of operational capital usage.
    - Mostly used by management
- ### Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)
    - Similar to ROIC, but uses a different calculation of capital employed. Both measure profitability relative to capital used.
    - ROCE = Net Income (PAT) / Captial Employed
        Capital employed : All non operating expences are also included 
    - Broad view on how overall capital is used
    - Captial employed over here looks at total equity + debt financing - short term liabilities
- ## Inventory Turnover ratio
    - Rate at which company is able to sell its inventory
## Leverage Ratio
- ### Debt to Equity (D/E)
    - How much company's operations are funded by borrowed money
    - D/E = Total Liability / Shareholder's equity
    - Its costly and better to finance captial using equity 
    - Its not a good practice to finance huge capital using debt
    - Hence lower the ratio better
- ### Retention Ratio
    - Part of income kept in business as retained earning
    - Retention ratio = (`Net income` - `Divident`) / (`Net income`) 
## Valuation Ratio
- ### Price to Book Ratio (P/B)
    - Measures if stock is undervalued or overvalued
    - P/B = Stock Price / Book Value per share (BVPS)
    - Book value is derived from a company's net value and is more conservative measure of company's net worth
    - There are times when book value can go down for good reason like R&D 
        - As R&D is reduced from income which may be paying wages, and buying assets for R&D 
        - Hence Price in P/B decrease
    - P/B might not be a good measure for companies with less tangible and high intangible assets like software and IT firms
- ### Price/ Earning-to-growth (PEG) ratio
    - A modified P/E ratio which takes growth into account
    - PEG = `P/E` / `Earning growth rate`
    - Lower PEG is better as
        - Lower P/E : Less to premium to pay to earn one rupee
        - High Earning growth rate : better as high growth
    - Earning growth rate = EPS of this year / EPS of last year

## Solvency Ratio
- ### Debt-to-Asset Ratio
    - Measues company's debt financing using assets
    - Lower the value better as much of capital will be financed using equity
- ### Equity Ratio
    - Equity of shareholder / Total Asset of company
    - Higher the value better it is
    - Investment financed by equity is always better then investment financed by debt

## Cost of Capital  
- Cost of capital is the total cost of raising capital including `cost of debt` and `cost of equity`  
- Weighted sum of cost of debt and cost of capital is used
- If the `return on investment` > `Cost of capital` the it is a good sign
- ### Cost Of equity
    - Expected return rate the an investor can expect
    - Cost of equity = `Risk free rate` + (`Beta` X `Market Risk Premium`)
        - Risk free rate : Interest rate that we can get easily from other negligible risk sources like T-bills, govt. bonds etc
        - Beta : How much is company risky then the market
            - Beta is a specific measure designed to quantify how much a stock's price fluctuates compared to the overall market
            - Beta == 1 : As risky as market
            - Beta < 1 : Less risky then market
            - Beta > 1 : More risky then market
- ### `Cost debt` and `After tax cost of debt`
    - The effective interest rate or total amount of interest that a compnay owes on a liability such as bond or loan
    - Generally `After tax cost of debt` is considered as there are tax benifits offered on loans and `After Tax cost of debt` considers tax benifits
    - It's value is in percentage : means what is effective percentage interest it pays on it's debts after tax deductions
    - It also says credit worthiness of a company

## Efficiency Ratio
- ### Equity Multiplier / Leverage
    - Equity Multipler = Total Assets / Total Equity
    - Say equity multiplier is 2
        - Which means half assets are financed by equity and other half by debt
        - The problem with debt financed assets are they need to be paid off by company either by income generated or by releasing new shares
        - Second method is not a good practice
        - First one is usually done in market but a check needs to be maintained that the debt can be financed by income generated
            - Company may not pay its long term obligation now but should plan to reduce it or when they become current liability they may become difficult to pay with income
- ### Degree of finanical Leverage
    - It is %age change in EPS to %age change in EBIT
    - If the income of company is stable then the earning per share would be realtively stable and company can take higher debts as it will be able to constantly meet its current liabilities
    - But if the company works in volatile sector or have volatility in the income then EPS will also change and hence company's debt taking capacity is low relative to its income
        - Like say there is an airline and its income is $10million for current finanical year so if takes loan and its current liability is near to income like say $7million so it may be difficult to pay in upcomming finanical year if the income decrease because it works in volatile sector
        - While say a steel company whose income is $10million for current finanical year and say it has current liability of $9million so it will be able to pay it off in current and upcomming finanical years as it works in relative stable sector
- ### `Enterprice Multiple` or `Enterprise value ratio`
    - Enterprice Multiplier = Enterprice Value / EBITDA
    - Where Enterprice Value = Market Cap + Total Debt - Cash and cash equivalent
    - As the name suggests it is used to know the company's value
        - High value means company is overpriced
            - Investor is willing to pay higher premium for each dollor
            - This can be justified if the company is making significant growth
            - If the company grows then the price will continue to grow but if the company wont meet its potential then investor might take the money out
        - Low value means compnay is underpriced
            - Either market has not seen its potential or the fundamentals of the compnay are not strong
    - It measures How much investor is willing to pay for every rupee of company's cash
    - It measures company's profitability

# Relations
- ## ROE and P/B 
    - If the P/B increases then ROE will increase
    - If ROE increase then then the investors are ready to pay higher premium for the same book value hecne P/B increase
    - Large discrepencies in P/B and ROE is red flag
        - When ROE is low and P/B is high 
            - This means stock is under performing(Low ROE) but it is overvalued (High P/B)
            - Not a very optimistic future
        - When ROE is high and P/B is low
            - This means high efficiency in operations(high ROE) and undervalued(low P/B)
            - Good to invest in 
        
- ## ROE > `Cost of Equity(COE)`
    - If ROE < `Cost of equity(COE)` then there is problem
    - As ROE is actual return on equity which we are getting and Cost of equity is the return which is expected returns 
    - Hence if ROE < COE then we getting less return then expected
- ### ROE and EPS
    - If two compnaies have same EPS but one compnay is more efficient then other say requires less asset
        - This wont be noticable in EPS
    - This Asset can be compared in ROE then one with high ROE will have better efficiency 
    - ROE looks at how well a company uses shareholders' money to generate profit, while EPS focuses on the profit allocated to each individual share.
- ### ROE and FCF
    - Think of a graph ROE on x-axis and FCF on y-axis
    - Now company with high ROE and high FCF are middle to old age successful business
    - And compnay with low ROE and low to negative FCF are new entrepreneur and risky business invest only if you know business in depth
    - Company with low FCF and high ROE are profitable company focussing on expansions which results in low FCF
    - And company with low ROE and high FCF are less profitable companies that dont know how to make company profitable and should stay away 


# Due diligence before investing
1. Find Market Capitilization of the company. Then find the market size how much market is unorganized
2. First things to notice in a company is the Revenue, Profit, Margin Trends for past few years (2-3 years)
    - Next is price-to-sales (P/S) and P/E ratio
    - Also see profit margins to see company is rising or falling and if falling then why due to expands or due to disaster
3. Check the same for the competitors in the industry
4. Value Multiplier : Compare PEG ratio of current company with other companies
    - P/E should be used with P/B, enterprice Multiple, P/S ratio
5. Management and Ownership
    - Check the bios of owners and see if they are changed
    - Also check if owners have high stakes in the organisations
6. Balance sheet
    - Here you see for all the debts and debt ratios and check if company is in any danger of defaulting or chances of defaulting on any short term obligations
7. Stock price history
    - See if there is high volatility in the stock 
        - if yes then short term investors invest heavily in the industry and is risky for long term 
    - If the trend for long term are down then also it is risky as the stocks are tanking 
8. Stock options and Dilutions
    - Check the 10-Q and 10-K report for something called `underwater` which I dont understand much but is a mal-practice
    - Also from these we can find other mal-practices if company does any
9. Expectiations
    - See throught the analyst reports and see their future expectations they add risks and the expansion plan if company has any or the market trend that can influence the company
10. Risks
    - Present in annual report



# Equity Valuation
- All the valuations learned are to access the equity of company whether it is under-valued or over-valued
- There are 4 different commonly used valuations
1. Comparable approach : More like relative valuation 
2. Dicsounted Cash Flow (DCF) 
3. Precedent Tranasctions : Compares the previous mergers and aqusitions of similar companies sector wise and size wise
4. Asset Based Valuation
5. Book-Valued Approach

### Discounted Cash flow model
- It says company's intrinsic value is company's value + sum of Future cash flows
- Using Discounted Cash flow model to find intrinsic value
    1. Owner's earning
        - Owner's earning = Cash flow from operations - Maintenance CapEx
        - This formula may be modified as 
            - +Depreciation +Amortaisation
            - +/- Other non-cash charges
            - Full CapEx
            - Changes in working Capital
    2. Growth in owner's earning and terminal Value
        - Say the company grows with the market with desent 7% interest rate
        - Then the earings will look like
        -   |Year|Growth Rate| Owner's earinings |
            |-|-|-|
            |FY21|-|10|
            |FY22|7%|10.7|
            |FY23|7%|11.45|
            |FY24|7%|12.25|
            |FY25|6%|12.99|
            |FY26|6%|13.77|
            |FY27|6%|14.6|
            |FY28|5%|15.33|
            |FY29|5%|16.1|
            |FY30|5%|`16.91`|
            |Total|= |134.1|
        - Then at the end of 10th year we assume that company is put up for sale
        - Then we find the price of company
        - This is called `Terminal value` 
        - This value is found using the ratio of `Market cap` to `Owner's earning`
        - First we find the average of this ratio (`Market cap` / `Owner's earning`)
            - Say average value of `Market Cap` / `Owner's earning` is 20
        - So to be on safe side we will take ratio to be 17
        - Now we will muliple this value with Owner's earning that we found at end of 10 year which in out case is `16.91`
        - 16.91 x 17 = 287.47  now adding the sum of revenue `134.1` which is `421.57` 
        - So `421.57 Cr.` is the market cap 10 years down the lane and say today's market cap is 250 Cr.
        
                So this is the cash flow projection of next 10 years
### Divident Discount Model
    
3. Discount to its present value
    - Say inflation is 8% so we need to discount it every year on inflation 
    - Which is dividing owner's earning with 8% ^ number of year
    -   |Year| Owner's earinings |Discount Divisor| Present value |
        |-   |-|-|-|
        |FY22|10.7|1.08^1|9.91|
        |FY23|11.45|1.08^2|9.82|
        |FY24|12.25|1.08^3|9.72|
        |FY25|12.99|1.08^4|9.55|
        |FY26|13.77|1.08^5|9.37|
        |FY27|14.6|1.08^6|9.2|
        |FY28|15.33|1.08^7|8.94|
        |FY29|16.1|1.08^8|8.7|
        |FY30|`16.91`|1.08^9|`8.46`|
        | Total | ||83.67| 
    - Doing same (8.46 x 17 = 143.82) + 83.67 = 227.49
    - Hence 227.49Cr. < 250 Cr. So the company is undervalued
    > - Here we took `8%` as discount rate generally `12%` is good discount rate
4. Add the cash reserves 
    - It can be cash reserves
    - Or the money invested in other companies
    - This will be under investment section of the companuy
5. Margin of safty 
    - Just add a 25-30% multipler to reduce the assumed value
    - Like we got 227.49 so we multiple 30% discount 
    - 227.49 x 0.7 = 159.24

# Industry analysis and company's foothold in industry (Economic Moats)
- If a firm has consistantly maintained high ROE,ROA,FCF,NPM for past few years then the firm is doing consistantly well
### How an economic moat is created?
- Are they creating something new, advanced, valuable, superior then others?
- Is the industry working on trust and the brand has gained the trust?
- Is the company offerring product at significatly lower price then exact same competitor's product?
- Is the company locking on customers?
    - Like say Adobe photoshop, specific advanced surgical instuments or implants 
    - it takes time and money to learn new products 
    - Then switching will be costly and time taking
- Locking custormers
    - Company has paitents, licences? which impact the industry
    - Ex. Pharma industry, microsoft liscence

### Finding how will this Economic moat will remain moat
- There are two things about the moats 
    1. Depth : How much profit it can make with existing prodcut and services
    2. Width : For how long will the existing product or/and services will be in demand
- Like there WD40 household lubrcant brand 
    - It has low profits (Low depth)
    - But offers good and reliable products which will remain in demand for ages (High Width)
- The there are software firms if they dont constanly upgrade their software they will be out of business, Hence
    - High margins (High depth)
    - Low time frame on a single product (Low width)

# Breaking Fundamental analysis into 5 parts
- Growth
- Profitability
- Financial Health
- Risk/bear case
- Management

## Growth
- If a company is giving stagnent high quality returns more then the economy then it will stop sooner or later
    - This is because the competition in market will try to take over 
    - More new firms will get into the business if the sector is giving stagnent profits to a company
- The true source of growth is the sales growth. Though profit growth can account for growth but this is short term as there is limit to which company can do cost cutting
- There are 4 ways that a company will have sales growth, if company is growing another way then it needs to be viewed with skepticism
    - Selling more goods and services 
        - This can be done only in some sector by market leaders
    - Raising Prices
        
    - Selling new goods and services
        - As wallmart did, it was first to sell all the groceries along with other items at one place in USA
    - Buying another company
        - Acquisions use to suceed only half of times (in old era)
        - If a company was to keep the same `growth rate` then it needs to buy more and more bigger firms
        - And more the mergers more difficult it is manage them  
- #### Ways to have unorganic growth (`RED FLAGS`)
    - If EPS is increasing at a very fast pace or rate of EPS growth is fairly high but the revenue growth and operating income growth is small
        - EPS can increase if company buys back shares
        - There is change in tax regime
        - If compnay has started from negative growth then the growth next year may seem overhyped
## Profitability
- This will seperate great company from average ones
- ROA(Return on Assets)
    - Compare this to get efficiency of company
    - This can be used to compare across industries
    - Say retail have low profit margin but have good sales turnover
    - On the other side say diamond seller have high margin but low sales turnover
    - Hence this balances out
- Add leverage(Asset/Equity) to it and it becomes ROE
    - Here leverage is how much debt is carried by shareholder's equity
    - High leverage should be seen skeptically depending on the sector and should be compared with the competitiors
- If ROE of firm is greater then 40% then something is off
    - Can be due to bad accounting practices
    - High leverage can also be one of the reason
    - Acqusitions can also be one of the reasons
- Free Cash Flow is another measure of firm's profitability
    - Think of it as : It is the excess cash that is generated from the business which is for the share holders
    - To compare it with other firms one metic that we can use is `Sales` / `FCF`
- Compare `FCF` to `ROE` matrix mentioned in `relation` section
- At last also check `ROIC` as it takes `Equity` and `Debt` in account 

## Financial Health
- When company increases it debt it `fixed cost` increases
    - `Fixed cost` is the cost to be paid by company annualy or quaterly 
    - It includes operational expences, loans, etc
    - If debt increase then the `fixed cost` also increase
    - On long run this debt is profitable when it is paid off then the fixed cost decrease and the profits increase
- When the debt is high then the company's earnings fluctuate a lot due to high interest payment
    - This can be seen in leverage in the ROE
- Also see TIE ratio
    - Greater then 5 : Very good
    - 2-5 : moderately good
    - Less then 2 : Concerning
    - You want to compare it over 5 years to see if company is getting riskier or better
- Then there is current ratio and quick ratio
    - Current ratio > 1.5 is good enough and is the ability to meet short term obligations : Current Asset / Current Liabilities
    - Quick ratio is better as takes highly liquid assets into account rather then current assets 
        - Quick ratio > 1 : Good enough

## Management
- If the top executives are paid more in bonus and stock options then it is a good sign that executives will have mindset that company is their own
- See if exectives and managers are paid based on the performance  of the company and not just because they existed
- Buying and selling of restriced stocks is a bad sign 
    - Restriced stocks are generally stocks with top officials
- Check for related party transactions
    - Like a company huge sum to ex-officials for consulting
- If CEO potraits him as hero then there is a problem

# 6 Red Flags in Financials
- ### `Decreasing Cash flow` and `increasing net income`
    - If Account recivables are not taken care off then this problem happens
    - Say a product is sold on line of creadit and the credit not recived 
    - This credit piles up in account recivables and nothing is displayed on cash flow from operations 
    - But still the inventory is bought using cash hence cash flow decrease
    - ### If the `rate of increase in net income` is not matched with `rate of increase in cash flow` then there is something fishy
- ### Serial changes
    - If a company is adding so many non-recurring gains year on year
    - Or if a company is adding one-time charges year on year that is fishy
    - One reason is they might be hiding their mistake or a bad product
    - Other reason is this cost might the cost of imporving firms
    - You can check are these really one time or occuring every quater
- ### Serial acquisition
    - This should be seen with skepticism
    - Company can easily cook books with this
- ## CFO and auditor leaving the company
    - If auditors change frequently then there is a problem
    - If CFO change at the time of emergency or when company is going down then there is a problem
        - It is normal for CFO to change companies but at the time of problem is not normal
- ### Bills aren't being paid
    - If the `rate of increase of Account Recivables` is faster then the `rate of increase of net income` then there is problem
    - Generally net income should increase faster then A/R
    - `Allowance for doubtful account` is the amount that might not be recieved, if it increase at rapid rate then A/R or net income 
        - Again there is problem
    - The reasons can be found in 10-Q filling
- ### Gains on investment
    - If company is using investment to boost its efficiency or profitability
        - This is done by wrongly reporting it under `cash flow from operations (CFO)`
    - Sale of asset can also be used to boost income and/or reduce expences  
- ### Pension plan
    - If company has few `pension assets` then `pension liabilities` then it has to divert its profits towards pension
    - This can be found under `pension and other postretirement benefits` or under `employment retirement benfits`
    - Projected benefit obligations is the pension that company will pay in future
        - Compare this with `Fair value of plan assets at the end of year`
- ### Employer tax benefits on ESOPs
    - When an employee exercises its stock options the company gets its tax deductions
    - Say an employee execrcised its options and has to pay 2 lakh rupees in tax so the company gets that 2lakh rupees benefit
        - This benifit is mostly added in CFO which in-turn shows elevated profit 
    - So when stock price tank so employees dont exercise their options which will
        - So the tax benefits are not recevied by company 
        - Again in CFO this benefit wont be shown and profits go down more
    - So this tax benefits should be substracted when calculating profits 
        - This can be found in `Tax benefits from employee stock plan` or `tax benefits from stock options exercised`
- ### Overstuffed warehouses
    - Company might predict increase in sales in upcomming quaters or launches new product which can cause inventory to pile up 
    - If this goes wrong then the inventories may pileup
    - This has to be noticed in inventory section for previos quaters and years both
        - And see if the inventories are not increasing at rapid rate
- ### Change in depreciation and amortization period
    - If company decides to change the life of an asset then this changes the book drasitically depending on the value of asset
    - Increasing life of asset can cause decrease in expense in income statement and increase profitability of a firm
    - It can impact ROE, book value, P/B, debt ratios
- ### Captializing expenses
    - An expense, if capitalized can be converted to asset and can be shown over longer period of time using depreciation and amoritzation
    - Like say marketing campaign, will be an asset whose payment will be reflected in cash flow statement
        - But in balance sheet and income statement it will shown under asset and depreciation and amoritzation will be the way of payment 
        - Hence the net profit for the current year will increase but for the upcoming year it will decrease

> # Some Points to be taken care of
> - If the promotors of company are family then there is a problem in company 
> - If the promotors dont have majority of shares then then there is a problem
> - Anslyse company by yourself then read the `analyst report` and compare it
> - A high P/E stock with strong barriers to entry is compounding machine, and a high P/E stock without barriers to entry is disaster
>   - If there are barrier to entry i.e sector is difficult to crack then there are more chances that compnay will sustain and there is less chance that new playes will cover the market
> - Compare P/E to its past for the same compnay
>   - You will get to know if the stock is overpriced then usual
>   - If you are willing to buy stock at this point where the P/E is high
>      - Then the company must have something that will give it enormous growth 
>      - Like new revolutionay product, high market growth rate, significant cost of saving through inovations
>   - If a company fials to do so then it invetors might loose confidance and sell stocks and cause P/E to go down
> - Cash flow is more supperior then earnings, as earnings can be changed by management but the cash flows are difficult to change  
>   - If operating cash flow is going down and earnings are going up then there is something fishy
> - Check the source of profits of the company is the assets or equity that is generating the profits
>   - How the firm able to fend off the competitors and how long will the firm be able to it
>   - Is it holding the competitors in hyper-competative industry
>   - Learn that every industry has a need or demand and the supply must be fulfilled but also see if the supply is not in excess
> - If a firm has consistantly maintained high ROE,ROA,FCF,NPM for past few years then the firm is doing consistantly well
